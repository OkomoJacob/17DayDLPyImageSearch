## Day 2: Learn OpenCV ; All you need to know
<hr />
<br />

### The basics of OpenCV and image processing, the fundamentals of OpenCV.

Whether you’re interested in learning how to apply facial recognition to video streams, building a complete deep learning pipeline for image classification, or simply want to tinker with your Raspberry Pi and add image recognition to a hobby project, you’ll need to learn OpenCV somewhere along the way.

The good news is learning OpenCV isn’t as hard as it used to be ealier, with less documentation that was even very difficult to navigate through.Today as we speek studying OpenCV has become significantly easier.

[https://opencv]OpenCV is a free and cross-platform(Linux, MacOs, Windows,Raspbian) python based package for computer Vision and Deep Laernig

### OpenCV Tutorial: A Guide to Learn OpenCV
<hr />

While this tutorial is aimed at beginners just getting started with image processing and the OpenCV library, I encourage you to give it a read even if you have a bit of experience.
A quick refresher in OpenCV basics will help you with your own projects as well.

### Installing OpenCV and imutils on your system
<hr />
* The first step to succeed in this tutorial is craete a new python virtual environment and install and manage OpenCV on your system (if you haven’t already).
 `$ pip install opencv`
Once your fresh OpenCV development environment is set up, install the imutils package via pip.
`$ pip install imutils`

-In this tutorial we’ll be creating two Python scripts to help you learn OpenCV basics:

#### Our first script
`opencv_tutorial_01.py`
opencv_tutorial_01.py   will cover basic image processing operations using an image from the movie, Jurassic Park (jp.png

From there,
`opencv_tutorial_02.py` will show you how to use these image processing building blocks to create an OpenCV application to count the number of objects in a Tetris image (tetris_blocks.png)
