## Using Real-Time Eye Blink Detection Using Facial Landmarks
In this paper, we'll use the Eye Aspect Ratio-EAR, which is quite iron that we're using something called 'EAR' to compute the metric of an 'EYE'

Traditional image processing techniques for detecting blinks were fairly complex and involved.
This method is fast, easy, efficient and easy to implement
	Eye localization
	Threshooding to find the whites of the eye
	Determining if the white region of the eye disapears for a period, indicating a blink.
